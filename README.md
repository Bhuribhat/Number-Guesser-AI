# Number Guesser AI

This program trains AI on MNIST Digit data set. It allows the user to draw a number on the screen and have the AI take a guess of which digit it is. This uses a **basic neural network** model.

**usage:**

```sh
>> py main.py
```

__TODO__:  
1. using CNN model with some noise in image
2. create ipynb (model)
3. Add image (GUI)
3. rename file name when saving (Entry)
4. improve accuracy
5. show top 3 probs in UI
